                                  OpenISA Tools

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing the required packages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This branch is designed to build everything in-place, outside a Docker
container, on Debian 9 host machine.

To install all needed packages, use this command:

$ ./build.sh install_pkgs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building the toolchain and the benchmarks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build the OpenISA toolchain and all MiBench benchmarks, use the following
command:

$ ./build.sh

On a machine with 8 GB RAM or less, there is a high chance of running out of
memory when building LLVM/clang. Set MAKE_OPTS to -j4 or less and try again
and it should work.
Note that build.sh is smart enough to skip re-building what was already built.

After the build process is done, env.sh may be sourced to put the tools in
PATH and allow them to be easily used.
