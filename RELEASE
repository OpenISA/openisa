OpenISA Tools

Current limitations:
--------------------

OiSBT, the static binary translator, is only able to operate with relocatable
ELF object files (.o). 

Avoid using .bss data since there is a known issue with handling .bss data. 
OiSBT relies on the ELF file offsets to layout the memory and the .bss data
does not really exist in the object file.

Watch out when using variable-arguments interface functions (printf) with
double. OpenISA aligns the double according to a 8-byte alignment and a
dummy parameter may be passed to the host printf function. Avoid this
by not using double parameters in odd argument positions.

Owing to some mystery, susan (mibench) needs to be compiled with "-debug-ir",
otherwise a bug is triggered and a function called "a1d28" gets renamed
to "a1d2\18" and the linker fails.
