Current limitations:
--------------------

OiSBT, the static binary translator, is only able to operate with relocatable
ELF object files (.o). 

Avoid using .bss data since there is a known issue with handling .bss data. 
OiSBT relies on the ELF file offsets to layout the memory and the .bss data
does not really exist in the object file.
