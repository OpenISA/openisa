 Port newlib OpenISA:

 Patched newlib/libc/include/machine/_default_types.h with patch from http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-02/msg00315.html
 to work around Clang issue
 Created new folder name: newlib/libc/machine/oi
 + Changed newlib/libc/machine/configure.in line 53 to report this new folder 
 + Changed newlib/libc/machine/configure line 813 to report this new folder 
 + Changed newlib/libc/machine/configure line 11883 to report this new folder 
 MACRO used at newlib/libc/include/machine/ieeefp.h:  __OI__
 MACRO used at newlib/libc/include/machine/setjmp.h: __oi__, __oi64, _oi_fpr, __oi_soft_float
 MACRO used at newlib/libc/include/sys/config.h: __oi__
   Note: the macro __oi__ is not yet defined by the OpenISA compiler, it still used __mips__
   Therefore, I commented out line 134 that links impure_ptr to a specific ELF section
 File newlib/configure.host updated to map oi* targets to machine_dir=oi
 Added libgloss/oi cloned from libgloss/mips
 Changed configure @ line 3324 to recognize oi-*-linux targets
   + Changed configure @ line 3492 to map oi libgloss directory to libgloss/oi
   + Changed configure @ line 3797 to map unsupported libs for target oi-linux
 Changed config.sub @ line 146 to include oi as a recognized target
   + Changed config.sub @ line 272 to define an alias for oi to oi-unknown 
   + Changed config.sub @ line 391 to define an alias for oi to oi-unknown 
   + Changed config.sub @ line 1594 to define an alias for oi to oi-elf
